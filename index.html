                                    in mind from the point of engineering it.</p>

                                    decisions and become a better version of ourselves? As applicable to me, I started with the problem of how 
                                    to learn design thinking. I looked at the different resources available, chose one resource, started practicing 
                                    design and got feedback. The same process was repeated several times and is still ongoing. Along the way, I have
                                    become much better at design than what I was when I started.</p>

                                <strong>Overview</strong><p>Followed the entire user-centered design process involving interviews, sketches, personas and prototypes and came up with an app Tecaid.</p>
                                <strong>What is Tecaid?</strong>
                                <p>Tecaid is an app that helps baby boomers request for timely technical assistance from local neighborhood high school students looking for community service credit.</p>

                                <strong>Problem Statement</strong>
                                <p>Baby boomers struggling to complete daily tasks through the use of technology and in turn, reaching out to their children as tech support.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Competitive analysis</strong>
                                <p>I looked at various competitors working on solving the same problem like SkillfulSenior.com, Teamviewer, etc. Each one of them assumed that either the elderly person has some knowledge of computer or has someone to help them in case of technical urgency.</p>
                                <strong>Sketches</strong>
                                <p>I started brainstorming the potential solutions by sketching them. Some of the solutions were asking local children for help, doing google search, asking a librarian, etc.</p>
                                
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_1.jpg" alt="">
                                <strong>Scenario</strong>
                                <p>I came up with a scenario for all my solutions where I thought it could be used. Below is the scenario for my actual solution.</p>

                                <strong>Personas</strong>
                                <p>To analyse my solution and making sure that I am designing for my target user during every phase of the design process, I came up with a persona. It would also help me at the end to measure the success of the product.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_6.png" alt="">
                                
                                <strong>Interviews</strong>
                                <p>I conducted interviews with a few baby boomers and some important things surfaced.<br/>
                                1.	Use of watsApp to connect the baby boomers was not encouraged a lot as it was very much dependent on demographics.<br/>
                                2.	The population in this range wants to get their work done as quickly and as much without frustration as possible and they like to ask for help. For this they consider, library as one of the best resource.<br/>
                                3.	One of the interviewees suggested that there would be a security issue with the primary school children, so why not consider high school children looking for community service credit.</p>
                                <p>Thus I shifted my focus to connecting baby boomers to high school children as by the above reasoning, the high school students would have much more motivation to help and also the security issue is somewhat eliminated.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Brainstorming</strong>
                                <p>While brainstorming with 2 of my peers:<br/>
                                a.	The idea about asking a librarian stuck to us the most as it is free and essentially the work gets delegated to someone else.<br/>
                                b.	Teaching google search idea came off as something which was very hard to implement but which can have very high impact.<br/>
                                c.	Using Teamviewer to help solve the problem had problems such as what happens when the issue is with connection of physical devices.</p>

                                <strong>Paper prototype</strong>
                                <p>I did the QOC analysis, to evaluate the features I want to put in the app and came up with 3 potential solutions and made paper prototypes out of them.</p>
                                <p>I tested my paper prototype with the same baby boomers and my peers to get their feedback. After several round of iterations, I was able to finalise a solution. Check out the video for the paper prototype <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5Knc2r5ShA'>here</a>.</p>

                                <strong>Digital prototype</strong>
                                <p>After that I converted the paper prototype into digital prototype to be developed into an app. Check out the video <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7cAYsU9Rv8'>here</a>.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>1.	When I showed my app to 3 of the target users, they were extremely excited about the app. They wanted to have it as soon as possible as they said there is a real need for it.<br/>
                                2.	Even checking with my peers, I received acknowledgement saying that this is definitely an issue that needs attention and my concept is something that addresses it really well.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p>1.	Focus on the need: The solution might change but the need would not.<br/>
                                2.	Always keep your user in mind while designing in every phase of the process.<br/>
                                3.	Getting feedback from target users is extremely important and there feedback supersedes any other type of feedback.<br/>
                                4.	Sketch your ideas in order to get people quickly on the same page as yourself.</p>

                                <strong>Role</strong>
                                <p>Principal UX designer</p>
                                <strong>Overview</strong>
                                <p>Designed a role playing video game to make high school students take action to curb climate change in a virtual environment.</p>
                                <strong>Initial Problem statement</strong>
                                <p>Develop a videogame to mitigate climate change.</p>
                                <strong>Stakeholder interviews</strong>
                                <p>Talked to a number of people in order define the problem in a better way.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/StakeHolders.JPG" alt="">
                                <p>We talked to 30+ stakeholders (which kept on adding during the process) and gathered data through them and came up with 4 major key takeaways.<br/>
                                a.	A game could really help teachers and environment if it is able to teach the students about climate change.<br/>
                                b.	Only privileged students have the luxury to care about climate change. Disadvantaged groups generally have bigger problems to worry about.<br/>
                                c.	Key audience is a high school student who care but not know what to do. His mind is still malleable.<br/>
                                d.	High school students believe that climate change is a debate.<br/>
                                e.	Teachers are willing to assign climate change videogame as an extra credit or homework.
                                </p>
                                <strong>Surveys</strong>
                                <p>The survey was meant to analyse the awareness of high school students about climate change, their excitement level for a game related to climate change and if they would be willing to pay for it.</p>
                                <strong>Survey Results</strong>
                                <p>Many high school students said that they know climate change is an issue but it is not highlighted enough. They were not really sure what they can do in regards to the same.</p>
                                <p>Approximately, 86% people mentioned that they would be willing to spend $5-$100 to play a game or for in-game purchases if revenue went to environmental charity.</p>

                                <strong>Secondary research</strong>
                                <p>We looked at 4 other popular games directly/indirectly related to climate change – Eco, climate change, Fate of the world and Sim City 5. We found that none of them focuses specifically on climate change, donates revenues towards climate change or allows teachers to use it as an evaluation tool.</p>
                                <p>From our research we found out about a psychological theory called self-determined theory. It says to make students learn something new, any task should contain 4 major things:<br/>
                                1.	Competence - We can succeed at a task, and that we are making progress towards that success.<br/>
                                2.	Autonomy - We also need to feel that the choices we make matter, and that we have meaningful options.<br/>
                                3.	Relatedness - We need to feel that our efforts are recognized by others, and that we are part of something larger than ourselves.<br/>
                                4.	Risk-taking - Try anything and have no risk of failure</p>
                                
                                <p>On running our concept through one of the educational experts, he mentioned that he loves the creative part of tricking kids into learning.</p>
                                <strong>Problem statement</strong>
                                <p>How might we make high school students do something about climate change in a feasible way. (Process in short: Empathy Map -> Grouping -> Research -> How can we)</p>
                                
                                <p>We created an empathy map to find out the pain and gain points of high school students who would be somewhat interested in climate change.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/Empathy Map_2.JPG" alt="">
                                
                                <p>From the empathy map, we grouped the pain points into some common themes.</p>
                                <p>1.	Behaviour<br/>
                                2.	Effectiveness<br/>
                                3.	Action items<br/>
                                4.	Seriousness</p>
                                
                                <p>We decided to follow the path of action items and thus came up with a “how might we?”</p>
                                
                                <p>Then we sketched out a few solutions.</p>

                                <p>From our research we found out that the total casual games market in US played by green consumers is $257m.</p>

                                <p>In order to test out the interest level of people towards this idea, we put out a google adword along with a survey and it got 80,000 impressions and 300 clicks and for the survey we got 166 responses.</p>

                                <strong>Business model</strong>
                                <p>From the survey we found that 67% more high schoolers were willing to spend money on video games or in-app purchases if the money went to an environmental charity.</p>
                                <p>Below image shows how the results change when the users know that their money is going to an environmental charity.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/SurveyInGamePurchase.JPG" alt="">
                                
                                <p>The major part of revenue would be from ads in the game and in-app purchases. We also looked at different promotional channels to promote our game like high school teachers and University of Michigan MOOC on climate action.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>We tested the prototype with random people at the University of Michigan, Central campus. We also went to a high school- Star International Academy in Dearborn Heights, to test it out with high school students.<br/>
                                The concept garnered positive reviews and was seen as a way good way of making people learn about climate change</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/pilot.png" alt="">
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p>1.	In a game, it is very important to educate the user about the concept and thus adopt a low floor and high ceiling approach.<br/>
                                2.	It is very important to get the feedback of the target user; while all other people come in the end.</p>

                                <p>To get a sense of our client’s domain and the problem they are facing. The biggest challenge for New Eagle was that too many of their processes on the operations side were manual and the systems weren’t speaking to each other.</p>

                                5.	Customers options in regards to payment on website are limited

                                <strong>Iteration</strong>
                                <p>The key themes were discussed with our client contact to find out the most problematic area which when solved will help them the most. 3 key themes emerged from this phase.</p>

                                <strong>Recommendations</strong>
                                <p>After brainstorming, we came up with 2 short term/low impact and and 1 long term/high impact solutions.<br/>
                                1.	Going paperless (Short term/low impact) – Using LilyPad, a plugin for Fishbowl, the order fulfilment software currently in place, which extend its capabilities to other devices like tablets, smartphones etc.<br/>
                                2.	Improving the webstore (Short term/low impact) – Adding more payment options for the client apart from the existing credit card payment only. Showing prices to customers but showing discounted prices to premium customers.<br/>
                                3.	Implementing a CRM (long term/high impact) – Implementing an ERP (Enterprise resource planning) system like BizSlate which integrates with their existing accounting software and helps in managing inventory and orders.
                                </p>
                                
                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>Our recommendations were highly appreciated and appraised by the entire operations team of new Eagle. Out of the 3 recommendations we recommended, 2 of them are currently being implemented.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process:</strong>
                                <p>1.	In interviews people try to appear ideal. So it is very important to listen to the things people are not saying.<br/>
                                2.	After developing interview protocol, conduct an interview to find out whether it works. This makes the future interviews much more valuable.<br/>
                                3.	Always back your recommendations with substantial amount of data, otherwise there are high chances of them being ignored.<br/>
                                4.	Involve the user and keep on checking with him about your findings to make sure you are on the right track.</p>
