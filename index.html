                        Jatin was not only a pleasure to be around but also a library of knowledge within the UX realm. Just by talking and working with him on a daily basis ensured that I would without a doubt come home with a new bit of knowledge that I didn't have prior. He loves the UX process and he's a great advocate to have on your team when it comes to planning and designing. He can take critical feedback, he knows how to check his bias and he questions everything that he lays eyes on. Any company would be lucky to have him.

                        I had the pleasure of working with Jatin for three months at Lenovo CoLab fellowship. He is a talented UX designer with a great technical knowledge of the field. I was particularly impressed by his skills in managing multiple tasks and keeping the team on track during the development process. He always pushes the team for excellence and timeliness. I think Jatin can be an asset to any team both as a designer and a developer. </br>

                        Jatin Gupta did usability work for a project examining the use of ridehailing services by people with vision impairments. His work included both working on the research design and conducting the actual field research. Jatin has a knowledge of accessibility issues, and the experience of conducting UX work with people with disabilities. In this specific case, his work took place in a low-resource field scenario, which involved the need to be agile on adapting the research design and logistics on the ground. Jatin is a solid and patient design thinker. In my teaching and research work with Jatin, I felt that a cultivated discipline was being truly attentive -- when he works on one thing, his entire focus on that alone. This makes him a very good listener and documenter of issues in a real world UX evaluation. </br>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Introduction</strong>
                                <p class="medium-body">As a UX/UI designer at K12 Insight, I worked as the sole designer for Engage - a survey creation tool. It is used by 3 sister companies with a completely different set of users - K12Insight (catering to school districts), Zarca interactive (corporate clients) and SoGoSurvey (DIY users).</p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Context</strong>
                                <p class="medium-body">The publish module within Engage was a cause for concern due to numerous methods of sharing that the platform had. More specifically, users were unsure which sharing feature to use and when. Additionally, the feature was also cumbersome, demanding a minimum of 4 steps from our users that included several questions within. A hefty demand leading to a hefty dropout rate.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>
                                    <span>It was clear that a redesign of the sharing workflow was needed so that users could launch their surveys as seamlessly as possible. </span>
                                </p>

                                <p class="medium-body"><b>Note: Since this was an extremely long project, I would only share the workflow of sharing by email. If you’d like to see other workflows, please reach out via email and I’d be happy to share.</b></p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Initial Goal</strong>
                                <p class="medium-body">Make sharing of a survey easier and faster.</p>

                                <ol class="medium-body" type="a">
                                    <li>I began the research by going through the platform myself and doing the heuristic evaluation.</li>
                                    <li>I looked at the direct competitors like surveyMonkey, Qualtrics, SurveyGizmo, and indirect competitors like Mailchimp to see how their survey sharing feature functioned.</li>
                                    <li>I conducted interviews with support staff to uncover the painpoints that our users face.</li>
                                    <li>I then interviewed the research team who use Engage to conduct managed projects for clients. They themselves are first hand users of the product. </li>
                                    <li>To check the usage frequency of our various sharing methods, I dove in to the analytics provided from Google.</li>

                                    <li>Overall, working on this project, made me realize how keeping on adding features to a product is not a good idea.

                                    <li>With such a big project, comes tight deadlines and pressure from the management. Thus keeping the management in loop at every step of the way and getting regular feedback so that you don’t derail is crucial to deliver on time.</li>

                                <p class="medium-body">In Engage: survey making tool of K12 Insight, the main account settings have too many options to choose from which takes away attention from the important settings. When it comes to finding a particular setting, it takes a user to scan through the entire side menu and make an intelligent guess to get to what they are looking for.</p>

                                    Since K12Insight actively discourages user research, I had to rely on other ways to do my research and making sure I am solving the right problem.</p>

                                        A game involves many complex interactions and thus it has to be prototyped (developed) in order for the person testing it to get the context right.

                                        The ability to exxplain the design changes to a designer which involves changes in their previously employed code is a very important and useful skill.

                                        Augmented reality is a very new concept and many people still don’t get the context. Thus making sure that the instructions which corresponds to the augmented reality part of the game are understood by an novice AR user, can go a long way.

                                        Hardness of a level in a game needs to be properly balanced. If too hard, the participant gives up but if too easy, it becomes uninteresting. Thus, having a level a little on the harder side makes the user remember the things taught.

                                        When aiming for a MVP, try to use and re-use as much of the interactions from the previous level as possible. This ensures consistency and make the player feel comfortable with the game. In terms of prototyping, it makes the task easier.

                                <p class="medium-body">The Honors program is a department within the College of Literature, Science and the Arts at the University of Michigan. This department maintains the LSA Honors website, which contains information for prospective and current students, faculty and staff, and alumni.</p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Context</strong>
                                <p class="medium-body">The Honors program recently shifted its website to a new Content management system. Thus the staff is forced to transfer all the information from the old website to the new website template which has caused problems in the way information is organized and presented.</p>
                                <p class="medium-body">This problem exacerbated when the number of emails from students unable to find information on the website; to the Honors staff increased. Thus, the staff realized the potential usability issues with the website including confusing navigation and text heaviness on some of the pages.</p>

                                <!-- My Role -->

                                <p class="medium-body">Our goal here was to identify usability issues and areas where the site could be improved. We used heuristics like Visibility of System Status, Consistency and Standards, accessibility etc. to conduct our evaluation.

                                <p class="medium-body" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">We conducted usability tests with 5 current students to identify how several features of the website like top-level and side navigation menus, quick links, search bar, accordions, headings etc. are helping the users to find the information they are looking for.</p>
                                <p class="medium-body" style="font-weight: 500;">Due to large amounts of text on pages, users used Ctrl+F (browser find functionality) to look for information.</p>

Also, when asked to find out about the Sophomore Honors award, all our usability test participants looked under Honors Awards and Grants page, which is understandable. However, the information is located under the Sophomore students page or the Honors requirements page.</p>

                                        Confirming assumptions using the web analytics data is a really good idea, but it should be done earlier in the process. In our case, we got the analytics very late in the process and thus we could not look at it carefully due to time constraints and adapt accordingly.

                                        Memories are multifaceted (moments, long term, different representations)

                                <p class="medium-body">Thus we began brainstorming into potential ideas for sketching and came up with a preliminary set of sketches to lay out the design of the idea.</p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Concept testing</strong>
                                <p class="medium-body">We tested the main features of the app by showing users wireframes and asking questions like interesting features, kind of memories, sharing memories with anonymous users.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered image-formatting" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/ConceptTesting.png" alt="">
                                <h6 class="medium-image-caption" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Wireframes of the main features of the app</h6>

                                <p class="medium-body">Based on the concept testing, feedback from other designers and considering the timeline of the project, we defined the scope to reach the MVP.</p>
                                <p class="medium-body">Thus we focussed on 3 main features of the app, that covers and explains the important aspects.</p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Feature #1: Ability to create a memory at any location</strong>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/screen_1.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 35%;margin-top: 5%;margin-top: 5%;">
                                <h6 class="medium-image-caption" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Create a memory screen</h6>

                                <p class="medium-body">This feature allows users to create a memory at a particular location which can be accessed by anonymous users. We also gave the users <b>ability to tag the memories</b> as from our research we found that: <b>Memories are multifaceted (moments, long term, different representations).</b></p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Feature #2: Discover memories at a particular location</strong>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/screen_2.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 35%;margin-top: 5%;">
                                <h6 class="medium-image-caption" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">Memories found at North Quad</h6>
                                <p class="medium-body">From our research we found that: <b>Location is worth a 1000 stories</b>. So in order to incorporate that as well as being the USP of our app, this feature allows users to access memories created at a specific location by anonymous users. </p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Feature #3: Collection of memories created by a user over time at different locations</strong>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/screen_3.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 35%;margin-top: 5%;">
                                <h6 class="medium-image-caption" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">All memories created by a user</h6>
                                <p class="medium-body">Based on our research, <b>personal (unusual, identity) experiences matter</b>. Thus another important feature we added was to allow the user to have a look at all the memories created by them throughout their lifetime.</p>

                                <strong class="medium-title">Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <ol class="medium-body" type="a">
                                    <li>
                                        Got a deeper understanding of social computing systems through the perspective of anonymity and moderation and the concept of social object.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Learned how to scope the features for a MVP with constraints and limitations.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        When working on a new concept, validating the idea before committing to it fully is a good idea.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
