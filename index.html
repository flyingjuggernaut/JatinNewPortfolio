There were opportunities where he stepped up to the plate and took lead on certain aspects of the project when it came to user testing. I was impressed by his level on knowledge on the issue. I was also impressed that he was curious with other aspects and fields of design and didn't just limit himself to UX.

                              "Jatin Gupta did usability work for a project examining the use of ridehailing services by people with vision impairments. His work included both working on the research design and conducting the actual field research. Jatin has a knowledge of accessibility issues, and the experience of conducting UX work with people with disabilities. In this specific case, his work took place in a low-resource field scenario, which involved the need to be agile on adapting the research design and logistics on the ground. Jatin is a solid and patient design thinker. In my teaching and research work with Jatin, I felt that a cultivated discipline was being truly attentive -- when he works on one thing, his entire focus on that alone. This makes him a very good listener and documenter of issues in a real world UX evaluation."</br>

                                <p class="medium-body">The publish module within Engage - the survey creation tool of K12 Insight, was a cause for concern due to too many methods of sharing. Additionally, the feature was also cumbersome, demanding a minimum of 4 steps from our users including several questions within to pubish a survey. A hefty demand leading to a hefty dropout rate.

                                    <span>It was clear that a redesign of the sharing workflow was needed so that users could launch their surveys as seamlessly as possible. </span>

                                <div class="medium-body" style="margin-bottom: -4px">Through the redesign of sharing options in Engage, we received highly positive reviews from the research team as well as management. The new design was able to achieve the following:</div>
                                <ol class="medium-body" type="a">
                                    <li>Reduction in the number of sharing methods from 21 to 4, without losing any functionality.</li>
                                    <li>Bring more visibility on some of the hidden features like mail merge.</li>
                                    <li>Reduction of steps to launch a survey</li>
                                    <li>Removal of redundant features to improve the performance of the entire module.</li>
                                    <!-- <li>Less chances of users getting lost or making mistakes as there is only one screen.</li> -->

                                    <li>Overall, working on this project, made me realize how keeping on adding features to a product is not a good idea. After a while, it gets too cumbersome to understand it for a new user. When thinking of adding a new feature, a lot of research needs to be done before it is shipped into the product.</li>
                                    <li>With such a big project, comes tight deadlines and pressure from the management. Thus keeping the management in loop at every step of the way and getting regular feedback so that you don’t derail is crucial to deliver on time.</li>

                                        They have to make sure to estimate the amount of carbs in the food they are going to eat correctly and then give themselves the correct amount of insulin. Moreover, they have to do it for all the meals that they are going to eat which is too much burden for a kid less than 8 years old.

                                        A game involves many complex interactions and thus it has to be prototyped (developed) in order for the person testing it to get the context right.

                                        The ability to exxplain the design changes to a designer which involves changes in their previously employed code is a very important and useful skill.

                                        Augmented reality is a very new concept and many people still don’t get the context. Thus making sure that the instructions which corresponds to the augmented reality part of the game are understood by an novice AR user, can go a long way.

                                        Hardness of a level in a game needs to be properly balanced. If too hard, the participant gives up but if too easy, it becomes uninteresting. Thus, having a level a little on the harder side makes the user remember the things taught.

                                        When aiming for a MVP, try to use and re-use as much of the interactions from the previous level as possible. This ensures consistency and make the player feel comfortable with the game. In terms of prototyping, it makes the task easier.
                                    </li>

                                <p class="medium-body">The Honors program recently shifted its website to a new Content management system. Thus the staff is forced to transfer all the information from the old website to the new website template which has caused problems in the way information is organized and presented.</p>
                                <p class="medium-body">This problem exacerbated when the number of emails from students unable to find information on the website; to the Honors staff increased. Thus, the staff realized the potential usability issues with the website including confusing navigation and text heaviness on some of the pages.</p>

                                        Confirming assumptions using the web analytics data is a really good idea, but it should be done earlier in the process. In our case, we got the analytics very late in the process and thus we could not look at it carefully due to time constraints and adapt accordingly.
