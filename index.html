                    I worked with Jatin on an exceptionally challenging product design project at the University of Michigan. While collaborating with him during user research, I was instantly impressed with his attitude to get his hands dirty in the field and provide the team with valuable qualitative user research data. His passion for user-centered design was reflected in his approach as he took lead in recruiting and interviewing, what can only be called one of the toughest niche users I had to deal with during academic user research, given the sensitive nature of medical patients we were trying to help with our product. I remember every time we didn't agree on a common approach, we ended up having passionate debates around the nuances of conducting user research in such scenario, and his knowledge and grasp over the UX design process became apparent. In a team of very high caliber product managers, designers, and engineers, Jatin’s passion for user-centered design left a lasting impression on me.

                    Jatin worked on a consulting project in my class on Project Management and Consulting. He did an incredible job, thrilling the client with a very high quality work product. He was an extremely hard worker, showed excellent initiative, was thoughtful and noticed key details to ensure project success and client satisfaction. I highly recommend him! </br></br> <i style="text-align:right;">(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amycell/" target="_blank"><u>Prof. Amy Cell</u></a>, President and Chief Matchmaker at Amy Cell LLC)</i>

                    Jatin Gupta did usability work for a project examining the use of ridehailing services by people with vision impairments. His work included both working on the research design and conducting the actual field research. Jatin has a knowledge of accessibility issues, and the experience of conducting UX work with people with disabilities. In this specific case, his work took place in a low-resource field scenario, which involved the need to be agile on adapting the research design and logistics on the ground. Jatin is a solid and patient design thinker. In my teaching and research work with Jatin, I felt that a cultivated discipline was being truly attentive -- when he works on one thing, his entire focus on that alone. This makes him a very good listener and documenter of issues in a real world UX evaluation. </br></br> <i style="text-align:right;">(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyojeet-pal-6b53672/" target="_blank"><u>Prof. Joyojeet Pal</u></a>, University of Michigan School of Information)</i>

                    I had the pleasure of working with Jatin for three months at Lenovo CoLab fellowship. He is a talented UX designer with a great technical knowledge of the field. I was particularly impressed by his skills in managing multiple tasks and keeping the team on track during the development process. He always pushes the team for excellence and timeliness. I think Jatin can be an asset to any team both as a designer and a developer.

                                <p>Tecaid is an app that helps baby boomers request for timely technical assistance from local neighborhood high school students looking for community service credit.</p>

                                <strong>Problem Statement</strong>
                                <p><b>Baby boomers struggling to complete daily tasks through the use of technology</b> and in turn, reaching out to their children as tech support.</p>

                                <strong>Competitive analysis</strong>
                                <p>I looked at various competitors working on solving the same problem like SkillfulSenior.com, Teamviewer,LogMeIn, Eldy etc. Each one of them assumed that either the elderly person has some knowledge of computer or has someone to help them in case of technical urgency.</p>
                                <strong>Sketches</strong>
                                <p>I started brainstorming the potential solutions by sketching them. Some of the solutions were asking local children for help, doing google search, asking a librarian, etc.</p>

                                <strong>Scenario</strong>
                                <p>I came up with a scenario for all my solutions where I thought it could be used. Below is the scenario for my actual solution.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_4.jpg" alt="">
                                <strong>Personas</strong>
                                <p>To analyse my solution and making sure that I am designing for my target user during every phase of the design process, I came up with a persona. It would also help me at the end to measure the success of the product.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_6.png" alt="">

                                <strong>Interviews</strong>
                                <p>I conducted interviews with a few baby boomers and some important things surfaced.<br/>
                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>
                                Use of watsApp to connect the baby boomers was not encouraged a lot as it was very much dependent on demographics.<br/><br/>
                                The population in this range wants to get their work done as quickly and as much without frustration as possible and they like to ask for help. For this they consider, library as one of the best resource.<br/><br/>
                                One of the interviewees suggested that there would be a security issue with the primary school children, so why not consider high school children looking for community service credit.</p>
                                </p>
                                <p>Thus I shifted my focus to connecting baby boomers to high school children as by the above reasoning, the high school students would have much more motivation to help and also the security issue is somewhat eliminated.</p>

                                <strong>Brainstorming</strong>
                                <p>While brainstorming with 2 of my peers:<br/>
                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>
                                The idea about asking a librarian stuck to us the most as it is free and essentially the work gets delegated to someone else.<br/><br/>
                                Teaching google search idea came off as something which was very hard to implement but which can have very high impact.<br/><br/>
                                Using Teamviewer to help solve the problem had problems such as what happens when the issue is with connection of physical devices.</p>
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_5.png" alt="">

                                <strong>Paper prototype</strong>
                                <p>I did the QOC analysis, to evaluate the features I want to put in the app and came up with 3 potential solutions and made paper prototypes out of them.</p>
                                <p>I tested my paper prototype with the same baby boomers and my peers to get their feedback. After several round of iterations, I was able to finalise a solution. Check out the video for the paper prototype <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5Knc2r5ShA'>here</a>.</p>

                                <strong>Digital prototype</strong>
                                <p>After that I converted the paper prototype into digital prototype to be developed into an app. </p>
                                <div style="text-align: center;">

                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>
                                When I showed my app to 3 of the target users, they were extremely excited about the app. They wanted to have it as soon as possible as they said there is a real need for it.<br/><br/>
                                Even checking with my peers, I received acknowledgement saying that this is definitely an issue that needs attention and my concept is something that addresses it really well.
                                </p>

                                <strong>Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>Focus on the need: The solution might change but the need would not.<br/><br/>
                                Always keep your user in mind while designing in every phase of the process.<br/><br/>
                                Getting feedback from target users is extremely important and there feedback supersedes any other type of feedback.<br/><br/>

                                <strong>Iteration</strong>
                                <p>The key themes were discussed with our client contact to find out the most problematic area which when solved will help them the most. 3 key themes emerged from this phase.</p>

                                <strong>Recommendations</strong>
                                <p>After brainstorming, we came up with 2 short term/low impact and and 1 long term/high impact solutions.<br/>
                                1.	Going paperless (Short term/low impact) – Using LilyPad, a plugin for Fishbowl, the order fulfilment software currently in place, which extend its capabilities to other devices like tablets, smartphones etc.<br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/Lilypad.png" alt="">
                                2.	Improving the webstore (Short term/low impact) – Adding more payment options for the client apart from the existing credit card payment only. Showing prices to customers but showing discounted prices to premium customers.<br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/webstore.PNG" alt="">
                                3.	Implementing a CRM (long term/high impact) – Implementing an ERP (Enterprise resource planning) system like BizSlate which integrates with their existing accounting software and helps in managing inventory and orders.
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/BizSlate.png" alt="">
                                </p>

                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>Our recommendations were highly appreciated and appraised by the entire operations team of new Eagle. Out of the 3 recommendations we recommended, 2 of them are currently being implemented.</p>

                                <strong>Learnings from the process:</strong>
                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>
                                1.	In interviews people try to appear ideal. So it is very important to listen to the things people are not saying.<br/><br/>
                                2.	After developing interview protocol, conduct an interview to find out whether it works. This makes the future interviews much more valuable.<br/><br/>
                                3.	Always back your recommendations with substantial amount of data, otherwise there are high chances of them being ignored.<br/><br/>
                                4.	Involve the user and keep on checking with him about your findings to make sure you are on the right track.

                                <strong>Overview:</strong>

                                <p>Created an anxiety relief band: stil that helps people in managing everyday stress.
                                Conducted user research using interviews and surveys, brainstormed and sketched concepts,
                                prototyped a looks like and works like model and showcased the same in a trade show.</p>

                                <p>I along with my 6 other team members (2 MBAs, 1 art and design, 1 engineering and 2
                                UX design students) developed an anxiety relief wristband that helps people in managing everyday stress.
                                While creating it, we went from a completely ambiguous phase of where we had to create a wearable that
                                can be worn routinely in daily life and solves some need, to presenting a fully developed product in a
                                trade show. During the process we talked to anxiety attack sufferers and medical professionals to make
                                sure that we solve the user’s need.</p>

                                <p>I led the user research phase by conducting the interviews with anxiety attack sufferers and medical
                                professionals and deriving important insights from them to drive the direction of the concept. I created
                                a conjoint analysis survey through which we could analyse the combination of features that was most
                                preferred by our users. I also helped the team in concept testing, creating the website for the product,
                                coming up with visual design for the product and realizing the works like model.</p>

                                <strong>Problem Statement</strong>

                                <p>As a part of the course on Integrated Product development, <b>we were given a problem statement of creating
                                a wearable that can be worn routinely and that solves a particular need for the user</b>. </p>

                                <strong style='font-size:20px;'>Process followed</strong>

                                <p>As we began to work on this problem, among the team we identified the fact that the wearable market space
                                seems to be saturated and unless the product does something essential that is not covered by wearables like
                                fitbit and Apple watch, it would not be perceived well by the users. </p>

                                <strong>Brainstorming</strong>
                                <p>We started looking at all the problems we could think of that needs to be solved. At this point we just
                                wanted to throw everything we had on the whiteboard.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic1.JPG" alt="">

                                <p>Then we grouped together similar ideas into some broad themes.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic4.jpeg" alt="">

                                <p><b>Going with our initial assumption of the wearable market being saturated, we decided to focus on a niche
                                market instead. With this criterion in mind, we started to vote and ended up with acute health management
                                and daily health as 2 prospective areas of research.</b></p>

                                <p>We split the team into 2 and researched both areas for a week. </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic2.png" alt="">
                                <p>In the end each group presented their findings to the other. </p>
                                <p>Then we went with the consensus and went with the concept that we as a team thought was feasible,
                                niche and worth pursuing based on our intuition. This concept was related to <b>solving the needs for anxiety sufferers</b>. </p>
                                <p>We began to explore this idea with full force starting with interviewing people who suffered with either
                                mild anxiety or extreme anxiety and by talking to medical professionals.</p>

                                <p>Some insights we got were: <br/>
                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'><b>Summary</b> - Everybody suffers from anxiety but the people who have anxiety attacks fail to manage it properly. Once the stress level starts to increase, there is a tip off point at which it is impossible to control and the person suffers from an anxiety attack.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Detection</b> – Heart rate increases, shallow breathing, tightness in muscles. External detection is very difficult.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Symptoms</b> – Increased heart rate, palpitations, uncontrolled breathing and sweating, extreme fear of death and passing out during severe attacks.<br/><br/>
                                <b>Coping mechanisms</b> – Breathing exercises, be directed to focus on a distraction outside of the self, needs some outside physical stimulus<br/><br/>
                                <b>Medication</b> – Decreases the frequency of attacks but doesn’t stop them. Some of the side effects include drowsiness, dependency and reduced effectiveness over time.
                                </p>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                In parallel, we continued our research and looking at research papers to increase our clarity of the anxiety detection
                                process and the measures taken to manage it. Some takeaways here were:<br/>

                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>

                                <strong>Concept testing</strong>
                                <p>We came up with <b>5 different concepts</b> in which this problem could be solved.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic7.png" alt="">

                                <p>We looked at <b>2 competitor products</b> as well to make sure that our product is different
                                from what is already present in the market and to see if the users prefer them over our
                                chosen concepts.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic8.png" alt="">

                                <p>For concept testing, <b>we mixed up all the products and presented them to 50 of our users</b>
                                (this included people who did not suffer from anxiety attacks but mild stress). </p>

                                <p><b>From the concept testing, the patch and one wrist wearable had the highest potential
                                market share and the expected value. The ring wearable was less popular, particularly in male populations.</b></p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic9.png" alt="">

                                Thus we arrived at the following conclusions:<br/>
                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>
                                The <b>product space was well received</b><br/><br/>
                                There is a <b>significant variety of coping mechanisms</b> available for dealing with panic attacks<br/><br/>
                                The product needs to be <b>customizable or focussed on a niche market</b><br/><br/>
                                The users showed a preference for a wearable that would act as a <b>discrete tool to manage their symptoms</b>

                                <strong>Role</strong>
                                <p>Principal UX designer</p>
                                <strong>Overview</strong>
                                <p>Designed a role playing video game to make high school students take action to curb climate change in a virtual environment.</p>
                                <strong>Initial Problem statement</strong>
                                <p>Develop a videogame to mitigate climate change.</p>
                                <strong>Stakeholder interviews</strong>
                                <p>Talked to a number of people in order define the problem in a better way.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/StakeHolders.JPG" alt="">
                                <p>We talked to 30+ stakeholders (which kept on adding during the process) and gathered data through them and came up with 4 major key takeaways.<br/>
                                <p style='border:1px solid black; padding:4% 4% 4% 4%;'>
                                A game could really help teachers and environment if it is able to teach the students about climate change.<br/><br/>
                                Key audience is a high school student who care but not know what to do. His mind is still malleable.<br/><br/>
                                High school teachers are teaching mixed messages when it comes to climate change.<br/><br/>
                                Teachers are willing to assign climate change videogame as an extra credit or homework.
                                </p>
                                </p>
                                <p>On running our concept through one of the educational experts, he mentioned that he loves the creative part of tricking kids into learning.</p>

                                <strong>Empathy Map</strong>
                                <p>We created an empathy map to find out the pain and gain points of high school students who would be somewhat interested in climate change.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/Empathy Map.JPG" alt="">
                                <br/>
                                <p>From the empathy map, we grouped the pain points into some common themes.</p>

                                Seriousness</p>

                                <p>We decided to follow the path of action items and thus came up with a “how might we?”</p>

                                <strong>Problem statement</strong>
                                <p>How might we make high school students do something about climate change in a feasible way.</p>

                                <p>Then we sketched out a few solutions.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/Sketches.jpg" alt="">

                                <p>Among the many different solutions, based on some factors like feasibility and favorability among team members, we came up with a solution.</p>

                                <strong>Solution</strong>
                                <p>Role Playing mobile game that makes high school students take action to curb climate change in a virtual environment.</p>

                                <strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>
                                <p>We looked at 4 other popular games directly/indirectly related to climate change – Eco, climate change, Fate of the world and Sim City 5. We found that none of them focuses specifically on climate change, donates revenues towards climate change or allows teachers to use it as an evaluation tool.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/CompetitiveAnalysis.PNG" alt="">

                                <strong>Surveys</strong>
                                <p>The survey was meant to analyse the awareness of high school students about climate change, their excitement level for a game related to climate change and if they would be willing to pay for it.</p>

                                <strong>Survey Results</strong>
                                <p>Many high school students said that they know climate change is an issue but it is not highlighted enough. They were not really sure what they can do in regards to the same.</p>


                                <p>Below image shows how the results change when the users know that their money is going to an environmental charity.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/SurveyInGamePurchase.JPG" alt="">

                                <p>Thus we began with working on the prototype for the game. Below are some of the initial designs for the prototype.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/InitialPrototype_3.PNG" alt="">

                                <p>Later on owing to the pervasiveness of mobile phones, we decided to make it as a phone game and went through another round of iteration before reaching the final design of prototype.</p>

                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>We tested the prototype with random people at the University of Michigan, Central campus. We also went to a high school- Star International Academy in Dearborn Heights, to test it out with high school students.<br/>
                                The concept garnered positive reviews and was seen as a way good way of making people learn about climate change</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/pilot.png" alt="">

                                In a game, it is very important to educate the user about the concept and thus adopt a low floor and high ceiling approach.<br/><br/>
                                It is very important to get the feedback of the target user; while all other people come in the end.</p>

                                a. Our methods involved getting familiarised with the database and documenting our personal experiences, notes,
                                issues, and concerns.<br/><br/>
                                b. We created a survey and sent it out to all the sites using the database. The survey was very successful and we
                                were able to get 25 responses in 2 days which shaped our recommendations a lot.<br/><br/>
                                c. We then started interviewing users from different sites. During the process, we also presented the interviewees with some suggestions that we came
                                up with, to test if they found them useful.<br/><br/>
                                d. Thus we gathered together the data from the interviews, surveys and our own research to find out the key themes
                                and brainstorm on some ideas for our recommendations.<br/><br/>
                                e. For the recommendations, we created 2 personas and scenarios keeping our target users in mind. We presented our
                                findings and conclusions, giving some visual examples of the proposed changes to the database.</p>

                                <strong>Context</strong>
                                <!--<p>For now: Check it out <a href="https://seelio.com/w/357d/arvr-design-intern-_-lenovo-healthdesignbyus-colab?student=jatingupta">here</a>.</p>-->
                                <p>This project came about as Phab 2 Pro, Lenovo’s new flagship phone has just come out and they were looking for content for it in order to market it better.</br>
                                T1DAR is an augmented reality game with a purpose to teach kids suffering from Type1 diabetes about how to take care of themselves, by making them take care of a type 1 diabetic pet.</br>
                                It is intended for kids in the age group 8-12 and suffering from Type 1 diabetes, whose parents want them to take up a sense of responsibility for their own health.</p>

                                <strong>Why is it a problem?</strong>
                                <p>a. Kids suffering from Type 1 diabetes go through a lot of struggle in managing it.<br/>
                                b. They have to make sure to estimate the amount of carbs in the food they are going to eat correctly and then give themselves the correct amount of insulin. Moreover, they have to do it for all the meals that they are going to eat which is too much burden for a kid less than 8 years old.</br>
                                c. The amount of insulin to be taken for a specific amount of carbs in a meal, can be very difficult to compute as well. Moreover, they have to make sure to take into account the carb ratio and correction factor as well.</br>
                                d. The educational material provided by clinicians is too long and hard to remember for kids.</br>
                                e. During the initial years of their life, their parents take care of it. But with time, the parents want the children to take responsibility of their own health. </p>

                                <strong>Initial goal</strong>
                                <p>To come with a prototype for a game that is fun, engaging, conveys all the learning points and can be tested with the kids at C.S.Mott children’s hospital.</p>

                                <strong>My role</strong>
                                <p>a. Worked as a game designer to come up with different levels of the game. Brainstormed, sketched, storyboarded and critiqued the different ideas to come up with the design of the level.</br>
                                b. Prototyped the game in Unity going through various design sprints.</br>
                                c. Conducted usability tests and A/B tests for validation.</p>

                                <strong>Objectives/success criteria</strong>

                                <p>Before we started working, we decided to define some key objectives that could help guide us through the design process. Some of the main objectives were:<br/>
                                a.	To make the game fun and engaging.<br/>
                                b.	Explain the concept of carb ratio, correction factor, insulin,  glucagon etc. to an 8-12 year old diabetic kid.
                                </p>

                                <strong>Research phase</strong>
                                <p>a. In order to understand more about Type 1 diabetes, we invited Dr. Joyce Lee, prof. of pediatrics in the Umich Medical school who explained us about diabetes and the common struggles associated with it.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/DrJoyce.JPG" alt="">

                                <p>b. Apart from that we carefully observed our in-house patient, a 12 year old girl suffering from Type 1 diabetes and asked her questions at regular intervals to make sure we understood the problem clearly. We were very keen to notice how she calculated the amount of carbs in a given food and what kind of food she preferred.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/testingPaperPrototype.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>c.	We performed competitive analysis, to see which all games are out there who are trying to do the same.</p>

                                <strong>Current situation</strong><br/><br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/Kit1.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>This is the actual kit used by Type 1 diabetic kids. Just by looking at the kit it can become extremely overwhelming for a 8 year old kid.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/InsulinPump.jpg" alt="">
                                <p>An insulin pump: currently used by Alexis to calculate the amount of insulin ot give herself.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/Glucagon.JPG" alt="">
                                <p>Glucagon: Whenever the patient’s diabetes becomes too high and gets out of control, glucogon is injected into them to get it back to normal. But It has to be done by someone else.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/EducationalMaterial.JPG" alt="">
                                <p>Educational material provided is too much for a kid to grasp and remember.</p>

                                <strong>Execution</strong>
                                <p>a.	We worked in 2-3 week design sprints following a strict agile methodology. At the end of each sprint, we tested the prototype with a participant.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/SprintReview.jpg" alt=""><br/>
                                <p>During the sprint, we started off with a brainstorming session, sketching the level design and then prototyping the same in Unity.</p>

                                <strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/Usability test.JPG" alt="">
                                <p>For conducting usability testing of the game, we tested it by making the kids play the game before we received it with the one that we received afterwards and having them take a survey. We conducted this test with 6 target (or close) users.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/Survey.png" alt="">
                                <p>A list of questions we asked the kids while conducting usability test.</p>

                                <p>After compiling the results of the survey, we were able to increase the engagement by 2.5% and the educational value by 5%.</p>

                                <strong>Next steps</strong>
                                <p>We had started with the design of next level. However, there were still some things that if given time we would have liked to do.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/Level3.png" alt=""><br/>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/Sublevelmenu.png" alt="">

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/T1DAR/NextStepsAccurateQuantity.png" alt="">
                                <p>Add an accurate visual representation of the quantity of food items. For e.g. 1cup of Milk, 1 cup of juice, 1 bowl of watermelon, 1 tsp. of sugar etc.</p>

                                <strong>Looking back or learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p>
                                  a.	A game involves many complex interactions and thus it has to be prototyped (developed) in order for the person testing it to get the context right.<br/>
                                  b.	The ability to exxplain the design changes to a designer which involves changes in their previously employed code is a very important and useful skill.<br/>
                                  c.	Augmented reality is a very new concept and many people still don’t get the context. Thus making sure that the instructions which corresponds to the augmented reality part of the game are understood by an novice AR user, can go a long way.<br/>
                                  d.	Hardness of a level in a game needs to be properly balanced. If too hard, the participant gives up but if too easy, it becomes uninteresting. Thus, having a level a little on the harder side makes the user remember the things taught.<br/>
                                  e.	When aiming for a MVP, try to use and re-use as much of the interactions from the previous level as possible. This ensures consistency and make the player feel comfortable with the game. In terms of prototyping, it makes the task easier.

                                <strong>Client</strong>
                                <p>The Honors program is a department within the College of Literature, Science and the Arts at the
                                   University of Michigan. This department maintains the LSA Honors website, which contains information
                                   for prospective and current students, faculty and staff, and alumni.</p>

                                <strong>Context</strong>
                                <p>The Honors program recently shifted its website to a new Content management system. Thus the staff is
                                  forced to transfer all the information from the old website to the new website template which has caused
                                  problems in the way information is organized and presented.</p>
                                <p>This problem exacerbated when the number of emails from students unable to find information on the website;
                                   to the Honors staff increased. Thus, the staff realized the potential usability issues with the website
                                   including confusing navigation and text heaviness on some of the pages.</p>

                                <strong>My role</strong>
                                <p>I collaborated with 4 other students from School of Information and was actively involved in each stage of usability evaluation.<br/>
                                a.     Conducted interviews (as an interviewee and a note-taker)<br/>
                                b.     Performed comparative analysis, heuristic evaluation and usability (both acting as a moderator and a note-taker)<br/>
                                c.     Collaborated in the creation of a survey</p>
                                <strong>Initial goals</strong>
                                <p>As we started, we had the goal of making the LSA Honors website more usable and useful for current students.</p>
                                <strong>Success criteria</strong>
                                <p>Reduced number of emails from current students, asking about the information already listed on the website.</p>
                                <strong>Scoping</strong>
                                <p>Upon recommendation from the client and the current students being the major users of the website, we decided to
                                  narrow down our scope and focus only on the current students’ section.</p>

                                <strong>Research Methodology</strong><br/>
                                <p><b>Research Method#1 : Interaction Mapping</b><br/>
                                  A static representation of the LSA Honors website highlighted all the possible action states and thus any navigation
                                  issues (if 2 actions lead to the same place) with the website.
                                </p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/InteractionMapFinal.png" alt="">

                                <p><b>Research Method#2 : Interviews</b><br/>
                                  We conducted interviews with 5 current LSA Honors students to find out about the kind of information they look
                                  for and the methods employed by them in order to find it.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/JoshPersona.png" alt="">

                                <p><b>Research Method#3 : Comparative analysis</b><br/>
                                  Through this, we wanted to see how other similar websites handle the issues
                                  related to information hierarchy, navigation structure etc.
                                </p>

                                <p>Presentation of information by LSA Sweetland writing center website.</p>

                                <p><b>Research Method#4 : Surveys</b><br/>
                                  To find quantitative data about the information seeking behavior and the overall attitude of current students towards the website. Received a total of 28 responses.</p>
                                  <p><b>In person help was the most frequently utilized method for finding information on the LSA Honors website.</b></p>

                                  <p><b>Research Method#5 : Heuristic evaluation</b><br/>
                                    Our goal here was to identify usability issues and areas where the site could be improved. We used heuristics like Visibility of System Status,
                                    Consistency and Standards, accessibility etc. to conduct our evaluation.
                                  </p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/a11y.png" alt="">
                                  <p>Using WAVE Accessibility system detects issues such as missing alt text, empty heading and links, problematic alt texts, etc.</p>

                                  <p><b>Research Method#6 : Usability testing</b><br/>
                                    We conducted usability tests with 5 current students to identify how several features of the website like top-level and side navigation menus, quick links,
                                    search bar, accordions, headings etc. are helping the users to find the information they are looking for.
                                    <p><b>Due to large amounts of text on pages, users used Ctrl+F (browser find functionality) to look for information.</b></p>

                                <strong>Main findings and recommendations</strong>
                                <p>1)   Navigation terminology could be improved: Information about some topics could be found at more than 2 places which makes it hard for the user to
                                  remember where to find it. Also, when asked to find out about the Sophomore Honors award, all our usability test participants looked under Honors Awards
                                  and Grants page, which is understandable. However, the information is located under the Sophomore students page or the Honors requirements page.</p>

                                <p><b>Recommendation</b><br/>
                                  a. More descriptive titles can be used for the pages that help the users in understanding what the page might contain.<br/>
                                  For eg.
                                </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/undescriptiveTitle.png" alt="">
                                <p>The Graduation for Honors Majors page talks in great detail about the process of completing an Honors Thesis, which is something that users may not
                                  be able to guess from the page title.</p>

                                  <p>2) Unclear information hierarchy on a page, which makes the pages hard to skim and thus relevant information being buried in a heap of text.<br/>
                                    a.   Many pages contain just a wall of text.
                                    b.    Pages lack headings and subheadings.
                                  </p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/walloftext.png" alt="">

                                  <p><b>Recommendation</b><br/>
                                    a.     Add proper subheadings.<br/>
                                    b.     Make use of lists, indentation and bolded text to emphasize important information.
                                  </p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/SweetlandChunking.png" alt="">
                                  <p>LSA Sweetland writing center’s website uses bold texts and headings which makes it really easy to locate information.</p>

                                  <p>3)    Accessibility issues - Recently, University of California Berkeley was asked to take off some of its free educational
                                    content as it was not accessible to people who were blind, deaf or hard of hearing. Read the complete article
                                    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/why-uc-berkeley-is-restricting-access-to-thousands-of-online-lecture-videos/2017/03/15/074e382a-08c0-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.6459b0aba510" target='_blank'>here</a>.
                                    Owing to that, we checked the website for accessibility standards and found several issues:<br/>
                                    a. Alt text attribute not set for many images, thus using the website could be challenge for screen reader users.
                                  </p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/a11y_1.png" alt=""><br/>
                                  <span>Using WAVE Accessibility system detects issues such as missing alt text, empty heading and links, problematic alt texts, etc.</span>
                                  <p>In addition, Heading levels are often skipped, and b tags are often used instead of h headings, which keeps screen reader users from skimming the webpage.</p>

                                  <p>b. Color contrast below the 4.5:1 standard. Sometimes there is low contrast between the different elements on the page.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/a11y_2.png" alt=""><br/>

                                  <p>c)     Use of b tags for headings. Screen reader applications rely on heading tags to jump to different parts of the page. Incorrect use of heading tags decreases the
                                    skimmability of the webpages for screen reader users.</p>
                                  <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/lsahonors/a11y_3.png" alt=""><br/>
                                  <span>Using b tags for headings</span><br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    <p><b>Recommendations</b><br/>
                                      a.     Add meaningful alt text to images. This will make sure that the website complies with the ADA (Americans with disabilities act) and make
                                      it more accessible to its diverse range of users.<br/>
                                      b.     Using proper HTML tags for headings (h2, h3 instead of h4 and b).
                                          Adding proper HTML tags like h2, h3 rather than b, would make it easier for screen reader users to skim the webpages.<br/>
                                      c. Use color contrast checker to make sure the color contrast meets the standard.

                                <strong>Next steps</strong>
                                <p>a. Research and analyze the more frequently visited pages using Google analytics data and use these findings to inform a redesign of the website’s information hierarchy.<br/>
                                   b. 	Complete a card sorting activity, in which participants organize topics into categories that make more sense to them, to reorganize the website’s information.
                                </p>
                                <strong>Shortcomings in the study</strong>
                                <p>
                                  1)    Many of our recruited participants either were associated with the LSA Honors staff or were extremely familiar with the Honors website.<br/>
                                  2)    Even after waiting for 2 weeks, we were only able to get 28 participants to respond to our survey, out of a total of 1900. Thus, the confidence level in the results obtained was very low.<br/>
                                    a)	Could have offered a raffle to encourage people to take the survey.<br/>
                                    b)	Employed other ways like approaching faculty to ask students in their class to take the survey.<br/>
                                  3)    All of our interviewees were freshman students which didn’t give us the complete perspective of the website usage by current students.<br/>
                                    a)	Offering participants some incentives to participate in our study could have got us a more diverse set of participants.
                                </p>

                                <strong>Looking back</strong>
                                <p>
                                  a. The timing of the survey could impact the results a lot. Since our survey was sent over the spring break, we were able to get very less responses on it.<br/>
                                  b. Confirming assumptions using the web analytics data is a really good idea, but it should be done earlier in the process. In our case, we got the analytics very late in the process and thus we could not look at it carefully due to time constraints and adapt accordingly.
                                </p>

                                <strong>Context</strong>
                                <p>Memorabilia is a novel social computing application which allows people to share memories at a particular location anonymously.</br>
                                a. Create a memory at a particular location which can be accessed by anonymous users visiting that   location.</br>
                                b. Take a look at all the memories created at a location, to know about the location history.</br>
                                c.Create a map of all the memories created by you at different locations over time.</p>

                                <strong>Why is it a problem?</strong>
                                <p>The university of Michigan diag is a very popular place on the campus showcasing a big M and offers a very scenic view of the different campus buildings around it.</p>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Diag1.png" alt="">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Diag2.png" alt="">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Diag3.png" alt="">
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Diag4.png" alt="">

                                <strong>Figured out the problem yet?</strong>
                              </br>
                                <p>This is the diag at 4 different years in the past.</br>
                                </br>But today when someone visits this place, they have no idea about what previously has happened in this place. And thus, they always find themselves wanting to find out more about the history of the place as to what made this place popular. </br>

                              </br>If you try to google search for the past of a place, the results obtained are not exactly defining of what has happened in the past at a particular location.
                              </br>
                                </p>

                                <strong>Initial goal</strong>
                                <p>Devising and designing a novel social computing system, validating it and then developing and deploying the same on Amazon AWS.</p>

                                <strong>My role</strong>
                                <p>I collaborated with 2 other designers from the School of Information and was actively involved in each stage of the process including research using interviews, competitive analysis, field testing and affinity wall and sketched and designed wireframes in Balsamiq for concept testing.
                                I also took lead in the development stage and guided the other designers on how to go forward with the design in order to develop it.</p>

                                <strong>Objectives</strong>

                                <p>Before we started working, we decided to define some key objectives that could help guide us through the design process. Some of the main objectives were:<br/>
                                a.	Allow people to be able to discover random memories to inculcate a sense of serendipity.<br/>
                                b.	Encouraging people to know more about a location bypassing time restrictions.<br/>
                                c.	Encouraging conversation between random strangers.<br/>
                                d.	Making people discover different locations based on memories created.
                                </p>

                                <strong>Success criteria</strong>
                                <p>a. How many of the users come back to using the app?</br>
                                b. How many users sign up to start using the app?</p>

                                <strong>Research phase</strong>
                                <p>Looked at movie trailers of movies like Harry potter pensieve and The Lake House, for inspiration related to how to depict memories.</p>

                                <p>Looked at big competitors like instagram, snapchat to see how they support sharing memories based on locations either through geo tagging or through the use of hashtags.</p>

                                <p>We found our closest competitor in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/05/drop-the-location-based-messenger-closes-1-25m-from-atlas-ventures-spark-capital/">Drop Messages</a>.</p>


                                <p>Observational interviews with college students (most accessible and form a substantial chunk of users of social media apps). Our questions were chunked into themes including creating memories, storing memories, sharing memories, location memories and interesting memories, so as to give us a overview of how people currently think about memories in general.</p>

                                <p>From the interview data, we created an affinity wall.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/AffinityWall.png" alt="">

                                <p>Main findings from the affinity wall:</br>
                                a. Location is worth a 1000 stories.</br>
                                b. People want to review selective memories (filters) </br>
                                c. Personal (unusual,identity) experiences matter  </br>
                                d. Memories are multifaceted (moments, long term, different representations) </br>
                                e. Sharing is depending on relevance/relation (strangers/friends) and context.
                                </p>

                                <p>Thus we began brainstorming into potential ideas for sketching and came up with a preliminary set of sketches to lay out the design of the idea.</p>

                                <strong>Sketch round 1:</strong>

                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Sketch1.png" alt="">

                                <strong>Further brainstorming</strong>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Sketch2.jpg" alt="">

                                <strong>Validating features</strong>
                                <p>For validating the features, we created wireframes and then took the concept to the field and asked our users questions like  interesting features, kind of memories, sharing memories with anonymous users.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/ConceptTesting.png" alt="">

                                <p>Thus based on the concept testing, feedback from other designers and considering the timeline of the project, we came up with a scope to reach the MVP.</p>
                                <p>Thus we focussed on 3 main screens of the app, that covers and explains the important aspects of the app.</p>

                                <strong>Screen 1: Create a memory</strong>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Screen1.png" alt="">
                                <p>Create a memory at a particular location which can be accessed by anonymous users. </p>
                                <p>This directly translates from our research finding: Memories are multifaceted (moments, long term, different representations).</p>

                                <strong>Screen 2: Memories at a location</strong>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Screen2.png" alt="">
                                <p>Access memories created at a location by anonymous users.</p>
                                <p>From research: Location is worth a 1000 stories.</p>

                                <strong>Screen 3: Your memories over time at different locations</strong>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/Memorabilia/Screen3.png" alt="">
                                <p>Have a look at all the memories created by you throughout your lifetime.</p>
                                <p>From research: Personal (unusual, identity) experiences matter.</p>

                                <strong>Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p>
                                a. Got a deeper understanding of social computing systems through the perspective of anonymity and moderation and the concept of social object. </br>
                                b. Learned how to scope the features for a MVP with constraints and limitations. </br>
                                c. When working on a new concept, validating the idea before committing to it fully is a good idea.
                                </p>
