                                    to learn design thinking. I looked at the different resources available, chose one resource, started practicing 
                                    design and got feedback. The same process was repeated several times and is still ongoing. Along the way, I have

                                <strong>What is Tecaid?</strong>
                                <p>Tecaid is an app that helps baby boomers request for timely technical assistance from local neighborhood high school students looking for community service credit.</p>

                                <strong>Problem Statement</strong>
                                <p>Baby boomers struggling to complete daily tasks through the use of technology and in turn, reaching out to their children as tech support.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Competitive analysis</strong>
                                <p>I looked at various competitors working on solving the same problem like SkillfulSenior.com, Teamviewer, etc. Each one of them assumed that either the elderly person has some knowledge of computer or has someone to help them in case of technical urgency.</p>
                                <strong>Sketches</strong>
                                <p>I started brainstorming the potential solutions by sketching them. Some of the solutions were asking local children for help, doing google search, asking a librarian, etc.</p>

                                <strong>Scenario</strong>
                                <p>I came up with a scenario for all my solutions where I thought it could be used. Below is the scenario for my actual solution.</p>

                                <strong>Personas</strong>
                                <p>To analyse my solution and making sure that I am designing for my target user during every phase of the design process, I came up with a persona. It would also help me at the end to measure the success of the product.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_6.png" alt="">
                                
                                <strong>Interviews</strong>
                                <p>I conducted interviews with a few baby boomers and some important things surfaced.<br/>
                                1.	Use of watsApp to connect the baby boomers was not encouraged a lot as it was very much dependent on demographics.<br/>
                                2.	The population in this range wants to get their work done as quickly and as much without frustration as possible and they like to ask for help. For this they consider, library as one of the best resource.<br/>
                                3.	One of the interviewees suggested that there would be a security issue with the primary school children, so why not consider high school children looking for community service credit.</p>
                                <p>Thus I shifted my focus to connecting baby boomers to high school children as by the above reasoning, the high school students would have much more motivation to help and also the security issue is somewhat eliminated.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Brainstorming</strong>
                                <p>While brainstorming with 2 of my peers:<br/>
                                a.	The idea about asking a librarian stuck to us the most as it is free and essentially the work gets delegated to someone else.<br/>
                                b.	Teaching google search idea came off as something which was very hard to implement but which can have very high impact.<br/>
                                c.	Using Teamviewer to help solve the problem had problems such as what happens when the issue is with connection of physical devices.</p>

                                <strong>Paper prototype</strong>
                                <p>I did the QOC analysis, to evaluate the features I want to put in the app and came up with 3 potential solutions and made paper prototypes out of them.</p>
                                <p>I tested my paper prototype with the same baby boomers and my peers to get their feedback. After several round of iterations, I was able to finalise a solution. Check out the video for the paper prototype <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5Knc2r5ShA'>here</a>.</p>

                                <p>After that I converted the paper prototype into digital prototype to be developed into an app. Check out the video <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7cAYsU9Rv8'>here</a>.</p>

                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>1.	When I showed my app to 3 of the target users, they were extremely excited about the app. They wanted to have it as soon as possible as they said there is a real need for it.<br/>
                                2.	Even checking with my peers, I received acknowledgement saying that this is definitely an issue that needs attention and my concept is something that addresses it really well.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p>1.	Focus on the need: The solution might change but the need would not.<br/>
                                2.	Always keep your user in mind while designing in every phase of the process.<br/>
                                3.	Getting feedback from target users is extremely important and there feedback supersedes any other type of feedback.<br/>
                                4.	Sketch your ideas in order to get people quickly on the same page as yourself.</p>

                                <strong>Overview</strong>
                                <p>Designed a role playing video game to make high school students take action to curb climate change in a virtual environment.</p>
                                <strong>Initial Problem statement</strong>
                                <p>Develop a videogame to mitigate climate change.</p>
                                <strong>Stakeholder interviews</strong>
                                <p>Talked to a number of people in order define the problem in a better way.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/StakeHolders.JPG" alt="">
                                <p>We talked to 30+ stakeholders (which kept on adding during the process) and gathered data through them and came up with 4 major key takeaways.<br/>
                                a.	A game could really help teachers and environment if it is able to teach the students about climate change.<br/>
                                c.	Key audience is a high school student who care but not know what to do. His mind is still malleable.<br/>
                                d.	High school teachers are teaching mixed messages when it comes to climate change.<br/>
                                e.	Teachers are willing to assign climate change videogame as an extra credit or homework.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>On running our concept through one of the educational experts, he mentioned that he loves the creative part of tricking kids into learning.</p>
                               
                                <strong>Empathy Map</strong>
                                <p>We created an empathy map to find out the pain and gain points of high school students who would be somewhat interested in climate change.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/Empathy Map.JPG" alt="">
                                <br/>
                                <p>From the empathy map, we grouped the pain points into some common themes.</p>
                                <p>1. Behaviour<br/>
                                2. Effectiveness<br/>
                                3. Action items<br/>
                                4. Seriousness</p>
                                
                                <p>We decided to follow the path of action items and thus came up with a “how might we?”</p>
                                
                                <strong>Problem statement</strong>
                                <p>How might we make high school students do something about climate change in a feasible way.</p>
                                
                                <p>Then we sketched out a few solutions.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/Sketches.jpg" alt="">
                              
                                <p>Among the many different solutions, based on some factors like feasibility and favorability among team members, we came up with a solution.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Solution</strong>
                                <p>Role Playing mobile game that makes high school students take action to curb climate change in a virtual environment.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>
                                <p>We looked at 4 other popular games directly/indirectly related to climate change – Eco, climate change, Fate of the world and Sim City 5. We found that none of them focuses specifically on climate change, donates revenues towards climate change or allows teachers to use it as an evaluation tool.</p>

                                <strong>Market research</strong>
                                <p>From our research we found out that the total casual games market in US played by green consumers is $257m.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/market.png" alt="">
                                
                                <p>In order to test out the interest level of people towards this idea, we put out a google adword along with a survey and it got 80,000 impressions and 300 clicks and for the survey we got 166 responses.</p>

                                <strong>Surveys</strong>
                                <p>The survey was meant to analyse the awareness of high school students about climate change, their excitement level for a game related to climate change and if they would be willing to pay for it.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Survey Results</strong>
                                <p>Many high school students said that they know climate change is an issue but it is not highlighted enough. They were not really sure what they can do in regards to the same.</p>
                                
                                
                                <p>Below image shows how the results change when the users know that their money is going to an environmental charity.</p>

                                <p>Thus we began with working on the prototype for the game. Below are some of the initial designs for the prototype.</p>

                                <p>Later on owing to the pervasiveness of mobile phones, we decided to make it as a phone game and went through another round of iteration before reaching the final design of prototype.</p>
                                <br/>
                                <strong>Screenshots of the final prototype</strong>

                                <strong>Business model</strong>
                                <p>The major part of revenue would be from ads in the game and in-app purchases. We also looked at different promotional channels to promote our game like high school teachers and University of Michigan MOOC on climate action.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/BusinessModel.png" alt="">
                                
                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>We tested the prototype with random people at the University of Michigan, Central campus. We also went to a high school- Star International Academy in Dearborn Heights, to test it out with high school students.<br/>
                                The concept garnered positive reviews and was seen as a way good way of making people learn about climate change</p>

                                <p>Some of the feedbacks we got were:</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/iia/feedback.PNG" alt="">
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p>1.	In a game, it is very important to educate the user about the concept and thus adopt a low floor and high ceiling approach.<br/>
                                2.	It is very important to get the feedback of the target user; while all other people come in the end.</p>

                                <strong>Initial Meeting</strong>
                                <p>To get a sense of our client’s domain and the problem they are facing. The biggest challenge for New Eagle was that too many of their processes on the operations side were manual and the systems weren’t speaking to each other.</p>

                                <p>We identified key stakeholders, did interviews in contextual inquiry style while interpreting them side by side, did background research and constructed an affinity wall. We found 5 main issues:<br/>
                                1.	Manual process<br/>
                                2.	Paper versus paperless<br/>
                                3.	Niche business keeps customers<br/>
                                4.	Customers uncertainty of the order status<br/>
                                5.	Customers options in regards to payment on website are limited
                                </p>

                                <strong>Iteration</strong>
                                <p>The key themes were discussed with our client contact to find out the most problematic area which when solved will help them the most. 3 key themes emerged from this phase.</p>

                                <strong>Recommendations</strong>
                                <p>After brainstorming, we came up with 2 short term/low impact and and 1 long term/high impact solutions.<br/>
                                1.	Going paperless (Short term/low impact) – Using LilyPad, a plugin for Fishbowl, the order fulfilment software currently in place, which extend its capabilities to other devices like tablets, smartphones etc.<br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/Lilypad.png" alt="">
                                2.	Improving the webstore (Short term/low impact) – Adding more payment options for the client apart from the existing credit card payment only. Showing prices to customers but showing discounted prices to premium customers.<br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/webstore.PNG" alt="">
                                3.	Implementing a CRM (long term/high impact) – Implementing an ERP (Enterprise resource planning) system like BizSlate which integrates with their existing accounting software and helps in managing inventory and orders.
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/BizSlate.png" alt="">
                                </p>
                                
                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>Our recommendations were highly appreciated and appraised by the entire operations team of new Eagle. Out of the 3 recommendations we recommended, 2 of them are currently being implemented.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process:</strong>
                                <p>1.	In interviews people try to appear ideal. So it is very important to listen to the things people are not saying.<br/>
                                2.	After developing interview protocol, conduct an interview to find out whether it works. This makes the future interviews much more valuable.<br/>
                                3.	Always back your recommendations with substantial amount of data, otherwise there are high chances of them being ignored.<br/>
                                4.	Involve the user and keep on checking with him about your findings to make sure you are on the right track.</p>

                                families who are possibly at risk of abuse and provide them with the resources that they need.<br/>
                                b. They work with Healthy Families America organizations located in different areas and where program 
                                managers manage and organize the caseload internally and are accountable to people funding them.<br/>
                                c. PCAA provide the organizations with a database: PIMS that helps them manage this data and prepare

                                <strong>Client problem</strong>
                                <p>a. PIMS was developed over 20 years ago and have still work in progress because the guidelines and 
                                the funders change over time and the populations which change as well.<br/><br/>

                                b. The new version of PIMS is still in its beta version and the project manager wanted to know the areas 
                                in which he should be focussing on in order to make PIMS more usable and useful for the sites.</p>

                                <strong>Original research questions</strong>
                                <p>1. How do people feel about the PIMS database currently? Where are its issues?<br/>
                                2. What steps could be taken to make the PIMS database better and more user-friendly?
                                </p>
                                <p>There were some areas that we particularly focused on while conducting our research: Participant home form, 
                                participant home visit form, standard reports and custom query.</p>

                                <p>a. Our methods involved getting familiarised with the database and documenting our personal experiences, notes, 
                                issues, and concerns.<br/>
                                b. We created a survey and sent it out to all the sites using the database. The survey was very successful and we 
                                were able to get 25 responses in 2 days which shaped our recommendations a lot.<br/>
                                c. We then started interviewing users from different sites. During the process, we also presented the interviewees with some suggestions that we came 
                                up with, to test if they found them useful.<br/>
                                d. Thus we gathered together the data from the interviews, surveys and our own research to find out the key themes 
                                and brainstorm on some ideas for our recommendations.<br/>
                                e. For the recommendations, we created 2 personas and scenarios keeping our target users in mind. We presented our
                                findings and conclusions, giving some visual examples of the proposed changes to the database.</p>

                                <strong>Key complaints from users</strong>
                                <p>1. Some reports give too much info, so they have to sift through the entire data set to find the info they are looking for.<br/>
                                2. Some fields like gender, DOB should pop up by themselves.<br/>
                                3. Custom query page could use a cheat sheet.<br/><br/>

                                <p>1. Auto-fill: Auto-filling of fields in forms, especially the more complex forms such as the Home Form and Home Visit Form.<br/><br/>
                                <img style="border: 1px solid black;" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/asb/autofill.png" alt="">
                                2. Sorting: Ability to sort the report data using criteria such as alphabetically, by SSW, by date, by status, etc.<br/>
                                3. Scrolling: Allow consistent scrolling on all pages, where one can scroll with a mouse and not have to move it over to the 
                                sidebar and drag or click the arrows several times.<br/>
                                4. Custom query: Having a SQL window where people can write their own queries and having a cheat sheet on the page for the not 
                                so tech savvy people.</p>
