                                <strong>Overview</strong><p>Followed the entire user-centered design process involving interviews, sketches, personas and prototypes and came up with an app Tecaid.</p>
                                <strong>What is Tecaid?</strong>
                                <p>Tecaid is an app that helps baby boomers request for timely technical assistance from local neighborhood high school students looking for community service credit.</p>

                                <strong>Problem Statement</strong>
                                <p>Baby boomers struggling to complete daily tasks through the use of technology and in turn, reaching out to their children as tech support.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Competitive analysis</strong>
                                <p>I looked at various competitors working on solving the same problem like SkillfulSenior.com, Teamviewer, etc. Each one of them assumed that either the elderly person has some knowledge of computer or has someone to help them in case of technical urgency.</p>
                                <strong>Sketches</strong>
                                <p>I started brainstorming the potential solutions by sketching them. Some of the solutions were asking local children for help, doing google search, asking a librarian, etc.</p>

                                <strong>Scenario</strong>
                                <p>I came up with a scenario for all my solutions where I thought it could be used. Below is the scenario for my actual solution.</p>

                                <strong>Personas</strong>
                                <p>To analyse my solution and making sure that I am designing for my target user during every phase of the design process, I came up with a persona. It would also help me at the end to measure the success of the product.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/tecaid/tecaid_6.png" alt="">
                                
                                <strong>Interviews</strong>
                                <p>I conducted interviews with a few baby boomers and some important things surfaced.<br/>
                                1.	Use of watsApp to connect the baby boomers was not encouraged a lot as it was very much dependent on demographics.<br/>
                                2.	The population in this range wants to get their work done as quickly and as much without frustration as possible and they like to ask for help. For this they consider, library as one of the best resource.<br/>
                                3.	One of the interviewees suggested that there would be a security issue with the primary school children, so why not consider high school children looking for community service credit.</p>
                                <p>Thus I shifted my focus to connecting baby boomers to high school children as by the above reasoning, the high school students would have much more motivation to help and also the security issue is somewhat eliminated.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Brainstorming</strong>
                                <p>While brainstorming with 2 of my peers:<br/>
                                a.	The idea about asking a librarian stuck to us the most as it is free and essentially the work gets delegated to someone else.<br/>
                                b.	Teaching google search idea came off as something which was very hard to implement but which can have very high impact.<br/>
                                c.	Using Teamviewer to help solve the problem had problems such as what happens when the issue is with connection of physical devices.</p>

                                <strong>Paper prototype</strong>
                                <p>I did the QOC analysis, to evaluate the features I want to put in the app and came up with 3 potential solutions and made paper prototypes out of them.</p>
                                <p>I tested my paper prototype with the same baby boomers and my peers to get their feedback. After several round of iterations, I was able to finalise a solution. Check out the video for the paper prototype <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5Knc2r5ShA'>here</a>.</p>

                                <strong>Digital prototype</strong>
                                <p>After that I converted the paper prototype into digital prototype to be developed into an app. Check out the video <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7cAYsU9Rv8'>here</a>.</p>

                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>1.	When I showed my app to 3 of the target users, they were extremely excited about the app. They wanted to have it as soon as possible as they said there is a real need for it.<br/>
                                2.	Even checking with my peers, I received acknowledgement saying that this is definitely an issue that needs attention and my concept is something that addresses it really well.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process</strong>
                                <p>1.	Focus on the need: The solution might change but the need would not.<br/>
                                2.	Always keep your user in mind while designing in every phase of the process.<br/>
                                3.	Getting feedback from target users is extremely important and there feedback supersedes any other type of feedback.<br/>
                                4.	Sketch your ideas in order to get people quickly on the same page as yourself.</p>

                                <strong>Initial Meeting</strong>
                                <p>To get a sense of our client’s domain and the problem they are facing. The biggest challenge for New Eagle was that too many of their processes on the operations side were manual and the systems weren’t speaking to each other.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/NewEagle_2.jpg" alt="">
                              
                                <p>We identified key stakeholders, did interviews in contextual inquiry style while interpreting them side by side, did background research and constructed an affinity wall. We found 5 main issues:<br/>
                                1.	Manual process<br/>
                                2.	Paper versus paperless<br/>
                                3.	Niche business keeps customers<br/>
                                4.	Customers uncertainty of the order status<br/>
                                5.	Customers options in regards to payment on website are limited
                                </p>

                                <strong>Iteration</strong>
                                <p>The key themes were discussed with our client contact to find out the most problematic area which when solved will help them the most. 3 key themes emerged from this phase.</p>

                                <strong>Recommendations</strong>
                                <p>After brainstorming, we came up with 2 short term/low impact and and 1 long term/high impact solutions.<br/>
                                1.	Going paperless (Short term/low impact) – Using LilyPad, a plugin for Fishbowl, the order fulfilment software currently in place, which extend its capabilities to other devices like tablets, smartphones etc.<br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/Lilypad.png" alt="">
                                2.	Improving the webstore (Short term/low impact) – Adding more payment options for the client apart from the existing credit card payment only. Showing prices to customers but showing discounted prices to premium customers.<br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/newEagle/webstore.PNG" alt="">
                                3.	Implementing a CRM (long term/high impact) – Implementing an ERP (Enterprise resource planning) system like BizSlate which integrates with their existing accounting software and helps in managing inventory and orders.

                                <strong>Did it work?</strong>
                                <p>Our recommendations were highly appreciated and appraised by the entire operations team of new Eagle. Out of the 3 recommendations we recommended, 2 of them are currently being implemented.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Learnings from the process:</strong>
                                <p>1.	In interviews people try to appear ideal. So it is very important to listen to the things people are not saying.<br/>
                                2.	After developing interview protocol, conduct an interview to find out whether it works. This makes the future interviews much more valuable.<br/>
                                3.	Always back your recommendations with substantial amount of data, otherwise there are high chances of them being ignored.<br/>
                                4.	Involve the user and keep on checking with him about your findings to make sure you are on the right track.</p>

                                <strong>Overview:</strong>
                                
                                <p>Created an anxiety relief band: stil that helps people in managing everyday stress. 
                                Conducted user research using interviews and surveys, brainstormed and sketched concepts, 
                                prototyped a looks like and works like model and showcased the same in a trade show.</p>
                                
                                <p>I along with my 6 other team members (2 MBAs, 1 art and design, 1 engineering and 2 
                                UX design students) developed an anxiety relief wristband that helps people in managing everyday stress. 
                                While creating it, we went from a completely ambiguous phase of where we had to create a wearable that 
                                can be worn routinely in daily life and solves some need, to presenting a fully developed product in a 
                                trade show. During the process we talked to anxiety attack sufferers and medical professionals to make 
                                sure that we solve the user’s need.</p>
                                
                                <p>I led the user research phase by conducting the interviews with anxiety attack sufferers and medical 
                                professionals and deriving important insights from them to drive the direction of the concept. I created 
                                a conjoint analysis survey through which we could analyse the combination of features that was most 
                                preferred by our users. I also helped the team in concept testing, creating the website for the product, 
                                coming up with visual design for the product and realizing the works like model.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Problem Statement</strong>
                                
                                <p>As a part of the course on Integrated Product development, we were given a problem statement of creating 
                                a wearable that can be worn routinely and that solves a particular need for the user. </p>
                                
                                <strong style='font-size:20px;'>Process followed</strong>
                                
                                <p>As we began to work on this problem, among the team we identified the fact that the wearable market space 
                                seems to be saturated and unless the product does something essential that is not covered by wearables like 
                                fitbit and Apple watch, it would not be perceived well by the users. </p>
                                
                                <strong>Brainstorming</strong>
                                <p>We started looking at all the problems we could think of that needs to be solved. At this point we just 
                                wanted to throw everything we had on the whiteboard.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic1.JPG" alt="">
                                
                                <p>Then we grouped together similar ideas into some broad themes.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic4.jpeg" alt="">
                                
                                <p>Going with our initial assumption of the wearable market being saturated, we decided to focus on a niche
                                market instead. With this criterion in mind, we started to vote and ended up with acute health management 
                                and daily health as 2 prospective areas of research.</p>
                                
                                <p>We split the team into 2 and researched both areas for a week. </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic2.png" alt="">
                                <p>In the end each group presented their findings to the other. </p>
                                <p>Then we went with the consensus and went with the concept that we as a team thought was feasible, 
                                niche and worth pursuing based on our intuition. This concept was related to solving the needs for anxiety sufferers. </p>
                                <p>We began to explore this idea with full force starting with interviewing people who suffered with either 
                                mild anxiety or extreme anxiety and by talking to medical professionals.</p>
                                
                                <p>Some insights we got were: <br/>
                                1.	Everybody suffers from anxiety but the people who have anxiety attacks fail to manage it properly. Once the stress level starts to increase, there is a tip off point at which it is impossible to control and the person suffers from an anxiety attack.<br/>
                                2.	Detection – Heart rate increases, shallow breathing, tightness in muscles. External detection is very difficult.<br/>
                                3.	Symptoms – Increased heart rate, palpitations, uncontrolled breathing and sweating, extreme fear of death and passing out during severe attacks.<br/>
                                4.	Coping mechanisms – Breathing exercises, be directed to focus on a distraction outside of the self, needs some outside physical stimulus<br/>
                                5.	Medication – Decreases the frequency of attacks but doesn’t stop them. Some of the side effects include drowsiness, dependency and reduced effectiveness over time.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>
                                In parallel, we continued our research and looking at research papers to increase our clarity of the anxiety detection 
                                process and the measures taken to manage it. Some takeaways here were:<br/>
                                1.	Data from wearables improves self-management by making data visible<br/>
                                2.	Growing number of consumers willing to adopt wearables for health<br/>
                                3.	Sensor technologies reaching maturity across domain<br/>
                                4.	Wearables could be applied with success in managing moderate anxiety through aided mindfulness (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, “CBT”) techniques<br/>
                                </p>

                                <p>We positioned our product to handle stress before it reaches the tip-off point.</p>

                                <p>We came up with 5 different concepts in which this problem could be solved.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic7.png" alt="">
                                
                                <p>We looked at 2 competitor products as well to make sure that our product is different
                                from what is already present in the market and to see if the users prefer them over our 
                                chosen concepts.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic8.png" alt="">
                                
                                <p>For concept testing, we mixed up all the products and presented them to 50 of our users 
                                (this included people who did not suffer from anxiety attacks but mild stress). </p>
                                
                                <p>From the concept testing, the patch and one wrist wearable had the highest potential 
                                market share and the expected value. The ring wearable was less popular, particularly in male populations.</p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic9.png" alt="">

                                Thus we arrived at the following conclusions:<br/>
                                1.	The product space was well received<br/>
                                2.	There is a significant variety of coping mechanisms available for dealing with panic attacks<br/>
                                3.	The product needs to be customizable or focussed on a nice market<br/>
                                4.	The users showed a preference for a wearable that would act as a discrete tool to manage their symptoms
                                </p>
                                
                                <strong>Conjoint analysis</strong>
                                <p>In order to decide on the optimum set of features to put in and among the 2 concepts from the concept 
                                testing, we created a card sorting survey with different cards showing the device location and the feedback 
                                mechanism with respect to price. The respondents were asked to arrange the cards in their preference order from highest to lowest. </p>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic10.png" alt="">

                                Some of the findings from the conjoint analysis were:
                                1.	Users are willing to pay more for a wrist wearable than a clip-on or patch wearable<br/>
                                2.	Users are indifferent to whether the wearable has an onboard screen<br/>
                                3.	Users prefer LED-guided breathing feedback, but there is also willingness to pay for vibrations or buzzes<br/>
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>Thus after putting this all together, we created a looks like model and works like model. </p>
                                <p>The looks like model had 2 options:<br/>
                                a.	A 3D printed wristband with slit in between where LEDs could be placed to guide the person in breathing<br/><br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/ipd/pic11.png" alt=""><br/>
                                b.	A customizable wristband in which the bands can be changed as per will.<br/>

                                <strong>Works-like model</strong><br/><br/>
                                <p>Sensors used - Pulse and skin conductance sensors<br/>
                                Output - Soothing vibrations and LED lights guide user through boxed breathing technique</p>

                                <strong>Client overview</strong>
                                <p>a. Prevent Child Abuse America(PCAA) is an organization aiming towards improving the lives of 
                                families who are possibly at risk of abuse and provide them with the resources that they need.<br/>
                                b. They work with Healthy Families America organizations located in different areas and where program 
                                managers manage and organize the caseload internally and are accountable to people funding them.<br/>
                                c. PCAA provide the organizations with a database: PIMS that helps them manage this data and prepare 
                                reports for showing to their funders.</p>
                                <strong>Client problem</strong>
                                <p>a. PIMS was developed over 20 years ago and have still work in progress because the guidelines and 
                                the funders change over time and the populations which change as well.<br/><br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/asb/Screenshot_ParticipantHome.png" alt="">
                                b. The new version of PIMS is still in its beta version and the project manager wanted to know the areas 
                                in which he should be focussing on in order to make PIMS more usable and useful for the sites.</p>

                                <br/><br/>
                                <strong>Original research questions</strong>
                                <p>1. How do people feel about the PIMS database currently? Where are its issues?<br/>
                                2. What steps could be taken to make the PIMS database better and more user-friendly?
                                </p>
                                <p>There were some areas that we particularly focused on while conducting our research: Participant home form, 
                                participant home visit form, standard reports and custom query.</p>
                                
                                <strong>Methods</strong>
                                <br/>
                                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/asb/process.png" alt="">
                                <p>a. Our methods involved getting familiarised with the database and documenting our personal experiences, notes, 
                                issues, and concerns.<br/>
                                b. We created a survey and sent it out to all the sites using the database. The survey was very successful and we 
                                were able to get 25 responses in 2 days which shaped our recommendations a lot.<br/>
                                c. We then started interviewing users from different sites. During the process, we also presented the interviewees with some suggestions that we came 
                                up with, to test if they found them useful.<br/>
                                d. Thus we gathered together the data from the interviews, surveys and our own research to find out the key themes 
                                and brainstorm on some ideas for our recommendations.<br/>
                                e. For the recommendations, we created 2 personas and scenarios keeping our target users in mind. We presented our
                                findings and conclusions, giving some visual examples of the proposed changes to the database.</p>

                                <strong>Key findings</strong>
                                <p>Attitudes: Overall people have a favorable attitude toward the database<br/>
                                Behaviors: The number one use of the database is for data entry<br/>
                                Characteristics: Data entry and custom queries were some of the areas for frustration</p>
                                <strong>Key complaints from users</strong>
                                <p>1. Some reports give too much info, so they have to sift through the entire data set to find the info they are looking for.<br/>
                                2. Some fields like gender, DOB should pop up by themselves.<br/>
                                3. Custom query page could use a cheat sheet.<br/><br/>

                                4. Keyboard Ability in the database could be improved.

                                <strong>High impact recommendations</strong>
                                <p>1. Auto-fill: Auto-filling of fields in forms, especially the more complex forms such as the Home Form and Home Visit Form.<br/><br/>
                                <img style="border: 1px solid black;" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/asb/autofill.png" alt="">
                                2. Sorting: Ability to sort the report data using criteria such as alphabetically, by SSW, by date, by status, etc.<br/>
                                3. Scrolling: Allow consistent scrolling on all pages, where one can scroll with a mouse and not have to move it over to the 
                                sidebar and drag or click the arrows several times.<br/>
                                4. Custom query: Having a SQL window where people can write their own queries and having a cheat sheet on the page for the not 
                                so tech savvy people.</p>
